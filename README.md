# Kalicomp
a barebones compiler implementation for the kaleidoscope language

Notes
1. kaleidoscope by default infers every variable to be of types double
Structure
1. Lexer takes text as input and breaks it into tokens along with token related metadata
2. invalid tokens if found will return ascii value  by lexer
